### Drop-in Ready Leadboard
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9594539/189463097-842fa273-a9db-4c06-a724-e605da075ab6.png)

[Found under addons/easyleaderboard/leaderboard/Leaderboard.tscn](addons/easyleaderboard/leaderboard/Leaderboard.tscn)

Instantiate this scene in your game and set the game name for the quickest leaderboard setup!! (game jammers thats for you!)

This scene will automatically use an EasyLeaderboard API node underneath.

You can pass in a custom row scene for it to use if you want to further customize the rows with things such as metadata parsing for game stats.

There are a number of other configuration options you can play with such as showing different buttons and number of results per page.

Connect to the main menu and new game button signals to handle when those are pressed!

---
### Score Submission Modal
[Found under /addons/easyleaderboard/leaderboard/LeaderboardScoreSubmitPanel.tscn](addons/easyleaderboard/leaderboard/LeaderboardScoreSubmitPanel.tscn)

You can add this scene by using the instantiate child scene option, and selecting the scene.

An EasyLeaderboard API nodepath must be provided for the modal to use for submitting scores.

Other information can be passed to the scene to pre-populate fields such as score and enable things like a cancel button.

---
### EasyLeaderboard API node
[Found under addons/easyleaderboard/api/EasyLeaderboard.gd](addons/easyleaderboard/api/EasyLeaderboard.gd)

This scene can be used to directly interact with the Easy Leaderboard API.

Connect into the provided signals to handle when scores are submitted or results are retrieved.

## :computer: API Configuration
### Using the User Defined hosted solution
#### Default validation system
You can opt-in to the default validation logic by appending "basic-validation" to your game's key name.

For example, if your game's key name is `garretts-game`, the score will not be validated at all.

If you change the key to `garretts-game-basic-validation` then the score will undergo so generic validation to check for tampering!

If you want more robust validation, see below!
