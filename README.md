### Full Leadboard Scene
[Found under addons/easyleaderboard/leaderboard/Leaderboard.tscn](addons/easyleaderboard/leaderboard/Leaderboard.tscn)


## API Node Configuration
### Using the User Defined hosted solution
#### Default validation system
You can opt-in to the default validation logic by appending "basic-validation" to your game's key name.

For example, if your game's key name is `garretts-game`, the score will not be validated at all.

If you change the key to `garretts-game-basic-validation` then the score will undergo so generic validation to check for tampering!

If you want more robust validation, see below!
